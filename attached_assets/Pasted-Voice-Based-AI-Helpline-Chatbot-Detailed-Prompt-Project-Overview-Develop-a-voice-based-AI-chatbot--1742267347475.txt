Voice-Based AI Helpline Chatbot – Detailed Prompt
Project Overview
Develop a voice-based AI chatbot that acts as a helpline, receiving calls from users and responding to their queries in a natural, human-like voice. The chatbot will function as a virtual customer support agent, handling inquiries about products, order statuses, delivery estimates, and general information.

Core Features
Call Reception & Initiation

The chatbot should receive incoming calls via a virtual phone number.
Integration with VoIP services (Twilio, Google Dialogflow CX, or similar).
The ability to start a conversation with a warm greeting.
Natural Language Understanding (NLU) & Speech Processing

Use AI-powered NLP models (e.g., OpenAI’s Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text, Dialogflow, Rasa, or IBM Watson).
Convert user speech into text and process intent recognition.
Generate natural-sounding responses using Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology (Google Wavenet, AWS Polly, ElevenLabs, or OpenAI’s TTS).
Real-Time Response & Conversation Handling

Provide dynamic, context-aware responses.
Handle multiple types of inquiries, including:
Product details and availability
Order status and estimated delivery
Refund and return policies
General FAQs about services
Maintain a conversational tone with natural pauses and expressions.
Support multiple languages (if required).
Integration with Backend Systems

Fetch real-time order details via integration with databases or APIs.
Retrieve product information from an inventory system.
Update order status and provide automated tracking links.
Call Routing & Escalation

If the bot fails to understand or resolve an issue, transfer the call to a human agent.
Provide an option for users to request a callback from an agent.
Logging & Analytics

Store call logs, transcripts, and customer interactions for analysis.
Track frequently asked questions and improve responses over time.
Technology Stack
Voice Call API: Twilio, Plivo, or Google Dialogflow CX
Speech-to-Text: Google Speech API, OpenAI Whisper, Deepgram
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Google Wavenet, AWS Polly, ElevenLabs
AI/NLP Engine: OpenAI GPT-4, Google Dialogflow, Rasa, or IBM Watson
Database: Firebase, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or MySQL
Backend: Node.js, Python (FastAPI, Flask, or Django)
Frontend (for admin dashboard if needed): React.js, Next.js
User Experience (UX) Flow
User calls the helpline number.
Bot answers with a human-like voice:
“Hello! Thank you for calling [Company Name] customer support. How can I assist you today?”
User asks a question, such as:
“When will my order arrive?”
The bot processes the request, fetches order details, and responds with:
“Your order is scheduled for delivery on [date]. Would you like the tracking link?”
If needed, the bot escalates the call to a human agent.
Once the conversation ends, the bot thanks the user and ends the call.
Enhancements (Optional)
Multi-intent Handling: Support for complex queries like “Tell me about the return policy and also check my order status.”
Voice Customization: Allow different bot voice personas for branding.
Sentiment Analysis: Detect frustration and escalate calls accordingly.
WhatsApp/SMS Integration: Follow up via WhatsApp or SMS for unresolved queries.
Expected Outcome
A fully functional AI-powered voice-based chatbot capable of handling customer queries over a phone call, providing seamless and automated customer support while ensuring a human-like conversational experience.
